Answer these questions based on the reading/watching:

1. In Knight Rider, why does each LED require its own pin?
   Because each LED receives the signal from Arduino board independently.
   
2. Why is Knight Rider 2 in the Arduino tutorial so much shorter than Knight Rider 1?
   Because in the code it uses Array function and "for" loop.

3. What resistor value should be used with the LEDs?
   220 Ohm
